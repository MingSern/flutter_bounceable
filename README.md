# flutter_bounceable

- A simple, interactive and customizable on-tap bounce animation that can be wrapped on any widgets that you like. 
- You can create custom bouncing animation similarly to apps like **Spotify** and **App Store**.

## Advantages:

- Truly simple and efficient.
- Customizable bouncing animation using `curve`, `scaleFactor` and `duration`.
- Options to control `onTap`, `onTapUp`, `onTapDown` and `onTapCancel`.
